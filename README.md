<img src="yelp-banner.png" width="800" height="275" />

Do you want to know the latest trends in the restaurant industry, but don't have the time or 
expertise to sort through Yelp data? This project takes care of the heavy lifting for you.

Using an **end-to-end data pipeline** built on **GCP** with **terraform**; using services like 
**Cloud Composer, Dataproc, Google Cloud Storage, and DBT**, YelpoSphere provide curated 
insights into the hottest new spots in town, the most popular dishes, and the trends shaping 
the industry. 

With this project, you'll have everything you need to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions about where to 
eat next.

### DVD Rental Data Transformation Pipeline using [DBT (Data Build Tool)](https://www.getdbt.com/)

![](dvd-rental-dbt.png)

This DBT project utilizes the DVD rental database and implements various transformations to clean and structure the data. A dashboard is then created to display the insights 
and analysis derived from the transformed data. The project demonstrates the use of DBT to perform data modeling and manipulation tasks, as well as the ability to create a 
user-friendly interface for data visualization.

### Polygon ETL Pipeline using [MageAI](https://www.mage.ai/)

![](mage-architecture.png)

This project is an exploration of using MageAI to build an ETL pipeline. The pipeline is designed to extract data from Polygon API, transform it to fit 
the desired format, and load it into a Postgres database. The pipeline is implemented using MageAI, a powerful tool for building and deploying data pipelines 
quickly and easily. This project demonstrates the capabilities of MageAI in terms of data extraction, transformation, and loading, and serves as a guide for 
those interested in using MageAI for their own data pipeline projects.
